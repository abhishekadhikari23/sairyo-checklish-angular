# A Simple Checklist, To-DO and Notes Taking App Made with Angular

Very simple project. To contribute just clone this repo and use the commands "npm ci" to install the packages and then "ng serve" to serve the web app in your browser.

## Overview

The project isn't well structured as I made this during early stages of learning Angular. I primarily develop on React and still use it, but thought of giving Angular a try. Anyways code is simple and self-explanatory.

## Thanks for taking your time in viewing this project ðŸ˜€
